              trees) of a given size is a structural parameter
              important in the analysis of algorithms, as it measures
              the expected maximum cost of a search in a tree. This
              parameter was studied first with generating functions
              and complex variable theory, yielding an asymptotic
              approximation. Later on, real analysis was used
              instead of complex analysis. We reduce further the
              conceptual difficulty by replacing the generating
              functions with the enumeration of monotonous lattice
              paths, whose graphical representations make the
              derivation more intuitive.",
